Documentation for making samples:

* Rule #1 of chemistry. Don't drink anything.

Making samples of ions, chelated to the dye.
Where ions are: Ba++, Ca++, and nothing:

Each sample consists of ~50 $\mu l$ of liquid solution, used to coat a coverslip and cured.

Solution Recipe:
~ 4 ml of glowy solution on 15*** ml of ion solution.
(Or glowy solution alone for unchelated)


Ion solution:
Ba++ at 30 mM


Glowy solution recipe:
PVA (Makes pores to trap Fluo)
Buffer (keeps the PH at 7.2 )

BAPTA solution (captures Ca ions in water )
Dilute Fluo-3(4)


1. Make Buffer + PVA (10ml)
*Buffer*
25 ml of 0.2 M imidazole
(9.3/2)ml -> ul HCI
(0.2 M HCI 0.493 ml HCI )

We have HCI at 36.5%
(in water, by mass)











Dissolve 600 mg of PVA in 10 ml buffer





2. add BAPTA to 250 uM

3. add Fluo4
